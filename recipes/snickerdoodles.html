        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A snickerdoodle is a type of cookie made with butter or oil, sugar, salt, and flour, and rolled in cinnamon sugar. Eggs may also sometimes be used as an ingredient, with cream of tartar and baking soda added to leaven the dough. Snickerdoodles are characterized by a cracked surface and can be either crisp or soft depending on the ingredients used. </p>
        <p>Snickerdoodles are often referred to as "sugar cookies". However, traditional sugar cookies are often rolled in white sugar whereas snickerdoodles are rolled in a mixture of white sugar and cinnamon. </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 ¾ cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon cream of tartar</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg </li>
            <li>1 ¾ cups white sugar, divided</li>
            <li>½ cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
            <li>1 large egg, at room temperature</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>¾ cup apple butter</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons ground cinnamon </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Step 1</strong> 
            <p>Whisk together flour, cream of tartar, baking soda, salt, 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon, and nutmeg in a medium bowl until combined.</p>         
            </li>
            <li><strong>Step 2</strong>
            <p>Mix together butter and 1 1/2 cups sugar in a large bowl until thoroughly combined. Stir in egg and vanilla until incorporated. Add apple butter and mix until combined. Pour in 1/2 of the dry ingredients and mix until just combined. Add remaining dry ingredients and mix just until no dry clumps of flour remain. Cover bowl and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or up to 24 hours.</p></li>
            <li><strong>Step 3</strong>
            <p>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.</p></li>
            <li><strong>Step 4</strong> 
            <p>Mix together remaining 1/4 cup sugar and 2 tablespoons cinnamon in a shallow bowl or pie pan. Drop tablespoon-sized pieces of dough into the cinnamon-sugar mixture and roll into balls, coating well. Place 1 inch apart on the prepared baking sheets.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Step 5</strong> 
                <p>Bake in the preheated oven until edges are just set, about 10 minutes. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheets for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.</p>
